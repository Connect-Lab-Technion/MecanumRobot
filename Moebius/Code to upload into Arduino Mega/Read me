In the Folder "Mecanum", there is a file called "Mecanum.ino"
This is the code we need to upload to the Arduino board via the Arduino IDE.

In the same folder, there are also .zip files. These files need to be add to the Arduino library (see Final Report for the PFCL pdf)

There is also a folder called "ros_lib". In this folder there are Arduino codes for differents usages of the robot (not relevant for the lab)
